# C-PROJECTS
This repository presents projects in the C language and shell scripting that cover a wide range of topics. It includes fundamental programming concepts, string manipulation, data structures, algorithms, system calls, file I/O, memory management, recursion, and shell commands to operate on files and systemÂ processes.

## Basic Programming Concepts
Projects reinforcing the use of variables, control structures, and functions.

## String Manipulation
Implementations of operations such as concatenation, searching, and substring extraction.

## Data Structures and Algorithms
Development of fundamental data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, and binary trees. Includes basic algorithms for sorting (e.g., Bubble Sort, Selection Sort) and searching (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search).

## System Calls and File I/O
Direct interaction with the operating system through system calls and file operations.

## Memory Management
Manual memory allocation, pointers, and handling memory leaks.

## Recursive Programming and Backtracking
Solutions utilizing recursion and backtracking techniques for problem-solving.

## Shell Scripting
Use of Unix commands to create scripts for managing files and system processes.

## Advanced Topics
Exploration of multi-threading, network programming, and basic cryptographic functions.

These projects highlight my ability to tackle various programming challenges, showcasing proficiency in writing efficient and maintainable code in both C and shell scripting.
